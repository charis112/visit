    <h1> First Visit To Shoprite Mall </h1>

   <p>Hi my name is Charis Malcolm. I am going to share with you my first experience at shoprite mall.<br>
   At Shoprite Mall, there were so many stores so with so little time. Some of the employees<br>ran up to me to greet me and ask if they can help me with anything. Others just let me<br>browse around and do what i wanted; they simply gave me breathing room.
    There are so many<br>diffrent techiniques to get someone to buy what you need them to.
    I went into a few diffrent stores so i can compare</p>
    <p>I went into a few stores so I can compare how the people were going to greet me<br>when I came in. The first I visited was Game store. They used the rule; meet the customer within the first thirt seconds. I think they may have over done it<br> on that.  As soon as I walked in they screamed, "Welcome to Game", how may I<br>help you?" That was what I pretty much expected. This is one of the neater and cleaner<br>stores that I visited. Everything was folded and packaged nicely and the employees were dressed in nice<br>clothes and watched every move I made. The most appealing and expensive items were<br>advertised in the front window and in the front of the store.</p>

    <h3>THESE ARE SOME PICTURES OF HOW THE GAME STORE LOOKS LIKE</h3>

    <p>After all my hard work of putting our purchased items into the bag<br> I was ready to relax, hopefully I would pick a store where I could sit down for a minute and relax. I looked around for a nice place to sit down and i ended up in a shoe store. Robert Wayne was the name. This store was small, but it had many products. There were only two people working in the store. But those two employees were hard workers. There were about six customers in the store, including myself and all of us had the same polite service from the employees. When I sat down she simply asked, "Its there anything I can do for you today." I told her I was just looking and she let me relax for a couple of minutes. It was just the thing I was looking for at the time.Robert Wayne was very nice, neat and they played music throughout the store to give a comfortable, inviting  vibe . All of the nicest shoes were displayed on a rack in front of the store and rest of the products sat on the remaining four walls of the store. There were also a couple of diffrent pairs of shoes in the middle of the store directly behind the chair I was relaxing in.</p>
    <p>Now I was hungry and I needed a Place to order food and sit down to eat so I roamed around until I found a shop or many food shops; kilimanjaro, KFC, Crunchies, Cold Stone e.t.c. So i compared all of them and check what they have on menu but<br>
    eventually I choose KFC becuase of their crispy chicken with very cold drink and fries with ketchup. Then we ordered it and sat down and began to eat.</p>
    <h2>THIS IS KFC AND OTHER FOOD STORES</h2>

   <p>As my day at the mall came to an end, i realized that each store i went to, I was treated like a valuable customer and thats the end of my first experience in Shoprite mall, thank you for reading!</p>
